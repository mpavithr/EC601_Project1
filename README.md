# User stories to application launch without humans
## Meenakshi Pavithran




### Problem Statement/Applications

Many people do not know programming and some of the applications we currently use cannot satisfy their needs. At this time, they want to create their own applications to meet the needs of themselves. For example, IOS shortcut. 

Many companies are developing this technology to solve realistic problems such as Lexis Nexis, Chisel, TeraDact solutions, PubNub.

Natural language processing can be used to analyze datasets of user stories and extract key words and sentiments for further analysis. After which, the extracted data would be connected with positive outcomes and applied to applications or customers.

An example of a current system is github copilot. It is developed by GitHub and trained on trillions of lines of code. It is able to generate sample functions from comments typed within the code. It gives the user the ability to tab through multiple function options with varying implementations. It was created to make trivial / common functions easy to implement and allow the programmer to move to more novel problems. The demo can be viewed on the following link: https://github.com/features/copilot
 

### Current Research

Natural language processing consists of 4 models that can be used for this project.

Types of models:
1. Domain specific language guided models - can capture the structure of a specific programming language; however, they require deep domain knowledge to generate the detailed syntactic and semantic rules. 
2. Probabilistic model - strong results for code completion tasks
3. N-gram - assumes each token/word is conditionally dependent on the previous n âˆ’ 1 tokens/words.
4. Neural networks - train on datasets

### Open-source research

GliaCloud is a platform that can create videos based on the words that users provide. It can even create avatars for users and execute natural-looking lip motions depending on the material. The conversion of natural language processing to SQL can benefit non-programmers. It enables teams to create video in minutes and optimizes the video production procedure.  GliaStudio is intended to transform the video making process for everyone. It intends to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reduce time spent on boring video production tasks, increasing productivity and freeing up creativity.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of machine learning and natural language processing to create applications without humans is a very promising field of research. In future research, it would be interesting to explore the ability of how to use NLP to create different kinds of applications.
